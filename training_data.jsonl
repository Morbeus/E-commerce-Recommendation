It will really get you started on the right track with quality, beneficial products.  I love my cars and am passionate about taking care of them.  I use some of these products daily, but I've tried just about everything in this kit.  Meguiar's brings top quality products at affordable prices.  I've used products from other companies that cost as much as this kit for one item, but yet Meguiar's is still always one of the very best.  Here is how I strongly suggest you use these products:1) The Gold Class Wash. This is the best car wash I have ever used.  Wash your car with this wash and the microfiber mit that is included.2) Clay - unless your car is brand new, you probably need to use the clay.  Use the clay along with the Quick Exterior Detailer, to make your paint smooth to the touch.3) Scratch X is actually a paint cleaner. You want to apply Scratch X to the entire car, to clean contaminants below the surface of the paint.  This step is very important.  Apply and remove, you can use the applicator that is included obviously.  The towel is also great to remove it with, but I like to use a towel to remove, and a second towel to buff it to a perfect shine.4) The final step - Gold Class Liquid Car Wax.  This is one of the best car waxes/sealants I have used.  There are other good, some even better perhaps, but this one is nothing to laugh at.  It is really good and delivers beautiful depth, shine, and protection!Your car should look a lot better after all those steps.  If you ever want to take it up another step, after Scratch X and before the wax, apply a pure polish (not included in kit) such as Deep Crystal Polish (Step 2 in that line) or #7 Show Car Polish.You can continue to use the quick exterior detailer you used with the clay. Use the exterior detailer by itself with a couple towels, to take dust or other contaminants off the paint between washes.  Use a couple towels along with it.  The exterior quick detailers are great.  I go through 1-2 bottles each week.Quick interior detailer you can spray onto a nice towel and apply to your dashboard and other surfaced inside the cabin.  It works great.  I use it all the time.  However, on the inside you don't need so much, so this lasts a long time.The Endurance Tire Shine is also great.  Just note your towel will really get dirty when applying this.  I even have to throw it away quite often.The plastic polish is great, if your headlamp lenses begin to lose their clarity.  Buff until clearer.Overall, a great kit.

It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product.

Furthermore, it looks unlike any wash product I have ever used.  It is rather opaque and thick, so there must be something special and different about the product as Meguiar's suggests.The cleaning ability was solid, if only the slightest bit weaker than Gold Class.  The suds were great, and it was a pleasure working with the pleasant smelling product.I dried the car thoroughly.  The result?  The car was clean and had a subdued sparkle to it.  However, the paint was not very slick and there was not much shine.  Certainly, even using a Quick Detailer leaves more shine afterwards than Ultimate Wash and Wax.  Therefore, I felt the need to follow up Ultimate Wash and Wax with Ultimate Quick Wax.  This restored the shine and slickness to my vehicle, but also questions the legitimacy of using a wash with theoretical protection benefits, if you still need to follow with a wax product.In conclusion, Ultimate Wash & Wax is another fine product from Meguiar's.  It's a pleasure to use and wash your vehicle with, and there are no significant negatives to using the product.  Perhaps others will find the product leaves more protection/wax than I found in my trial.However, like many wash and wax products, the protection provided by any car shampoo/wash seems to be almost non existent.  The wash and wax products usually have a higher price tag, so many will find it more price effective to simply get Meguiar's Gold Class wash and follow it with a Quick Wax for touch up maintenance, or a regular wax for full protection, if you have not waxed in a while.However, for those wanting to try something new or hold onto the hope that there might be some small protection left by a car wash after all, Ultimate Wash and Wax is another solid product from the folks at Meguiar's!\n\nRecommend a product and explain why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I recommend product B003EQ9QAW because it aligns with your preferences.

The wash and wax products usually have a higher price tag, so many will find it more price effective to simply get Meguiar's Gold Class wash and follow it with a Quick Wax for touch up maintenance, or a regular wax for full protection, if you have not waxed in a while.However, for those wanting to try something new or hold onto the hope that there might be some small protection left by a car wash after all, Ultimate Wash and Wax is another solid product from the folks at Meguiar's!\n\nProduct: B003EQ9QAW\nRating: 4.0/5\nReview: Mobil 1 ESP Formula M 5w40 is a quality product.  This is a synthetic motor oil with a low SAPS formula, to protect the emissions systems of today's complex diesel vehicles.  Specifically, this oil is for use in today's DIESEL powered Mercedes-Benz automobiles.It should be noted that many years ago for a short period, some dealers were putting this ESP product in gasoline cars.  However, MBUSA corrected that quickly.  This ESP product is for your diesel powered Mercedes-Benz requiring oil spec 229.51.Gasoline cars require Mercedes spec 229.5.  The spec numbers may look similar, but they are indeed different.The gasoline version has many more additives in it, to keep the oil suitable for long service intervals that Mercedes advises.  Those additives keep the acidic levels from engine combustion neutralized, so that your engine remains protected for your entire oil change interval.Now, for diesel powered Mercedes-Benz.  This ESP product will serve you nicely.There is also a non-ESP version of Formula M that some dealers use in gasoline cars, which is indeed approved. However, you will not see the gasoline application version of Formula M  for consumer retail commonly. Therefore, if you see a Formula M on a regular store's shelves, it likely this diesel, ESP formula for diesel vehicles.The easiest to find 229.5 spec Mercedes approved oil for gasoline powered cars is Mobil 1 0w40.This product shown above Formula M ESP is perfect for your diesel Mercedes-Benz requiring 229.51.Please keep this QUALITY product for use only in your diesel powered Mercedes.  It serves that application beautifully, indeed it is the same product the majority of Mercedes-Benz dealers use in diesel vehicles!

I purchased this because the lowest cost per quart price.  I like the product, I use it in my Honda and Toyota vehicles.  It is more work for me to use in this form but it was my mistake, I will pay a bit more next time, either a gallon container or regular quart size.  For now, I am filling a quart bottle from this and transferring the quart bottle one at a time to my transmissions.UDPATE 10/26/13: Just a little update about my experience with the 6 gallon box size.  As I stated above, I have been transferring to a Castrol Transmax quart and filling my transmission in my cars.  One thing I noticed is because the Castrol quart contaniners are black AND the Transmax is red, it is very hard to see the level as I fill in the quart container.  Compared to standard engine oil quarts which one can easily see on the side of the container where the level of oil is in the container, I need a strong light from above so I can peak into the Castrol quart containers.  Not a big deal except for an occassional overfilling, but just a FYI for others who are planning on ordering the box size.My future plan is to maybe continue buying this box if it still nets me the lowest $/quart and then use a funnel and clean gallon container, like milk or vinegar container to transfer.  Mark lines for different quart levels on the container.  This will give me the best of both worlds, best quart value AND easy and clean transfers.I also looked into what I paid back on 5/13 and for everyone's reference, it was $101 ($4.20 per quart).Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.\n\nRecommend a product and explain why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I recommend product B003ZAGPGU because it aligns with your preferences.

I wanted to stay with a rubber product for use on the ground and especially on the Race Ramps because I didn't want to risk damage to the ramps.  Really nice and heavy, does what it claims, prevents wheels from moving accidentally.I also have a pair of metal wheel chocks that are made in the USA and while I still use those, these have become my favorite, the metal ones have shown their age with rust around the chocks.The only negative that I can post about is the cost.

These are lightweight and I like the pin through design, provides a much better safety design and better piece of mind.  The only thing is I may consider is lengthening the chain to be able to slide the pin on top, above the the red portion instead, directly through the grey extendable section.  If I work on many different heights, it will be easier to move the heights around.  The base is flat without any wobble.  The top support is approximately under 3\" x 3\" surface area.I have a couple pairs and I recommend these over the ratchet types.  These are slower to release and drop down than the ratchets but clearly easier to see the jacks are 'locked' and ready to use, over the ratchet types.  Plus, no fear of rusting.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.\n\nRecommend a product and explain why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I recommend product B003IOKPLO because it aligns with your preferences.
